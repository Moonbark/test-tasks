Task 2
In this task, the list items are all different sizes, but we want them to be displayed as three equal sized columns, no matter what content is in each item.

Additional question:
Can you now make the first item twice the size of the other items?

Starting HTML:
<nav>
<ul>
  <li>I am small</li>
  <li>I have more content than the very small item.</li>
  <li>I have lots of content. So much content that I don't know where it is all going to go. I'm glad that CSS is pretty good at dealing with situations where we end up with more words than expected!</li>
</ul>
</nav>

Starting CSS:
ul {
  
}

li {

}
