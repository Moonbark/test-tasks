Task 3
In this task, there are two elements in the HTML below, a <div> element with a class of parent which contains another <div> element with a class of child. Use flexbox to center the child inside the parent. Note that there is not just one possible solution here.

Starting HTML:
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child">Center me.</div>
</div>


Starting CSS:
.parent {
          
}

.child {

}
